    <h2 class="city"; id="razdel1">1. English mastiff</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/pict/mastf.jpg" alt="Mastiff" width="700" height="320"></p>
    <p>The English Mastiff is one of the oldest English breeds of mastiff dogs. He is not only the largest in his family of mastiffs, but is also considered the largest dog in terms of body weight in the world.
        The average weight of this "baby" ranges from 60 to 100 kg! The height of the English Mastiff can be from 68 to 76 cm at the withers. 
        The most outstanding representative of this breed is a dog named Aikama Zorba, born back in 1981. The weight of this unique male was 155 kg and his height was 94 cm! He was entered in the Guinness Book of Records as the tallest and heaviest dog in the world.

    <h2 class="city"; id="razdel2">2. Pyrenean mountain dog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/pict/pirenej.jpg" alt="Pyrenean mountain dog" width="700" height="330"></p>
    <p>The Pyrenean Mountain Dog (or Great Pyrenees) is originally from France. But dogs came to the French part of the Pyrenees from Spain, where at one time they came from Asia along with the nomads. 
        The Tibetan Mastiff is considered the distant ancestor of the Pyrenean mountain dog. 
        The breed was bred by shepherds, who specially selected large individuals with white wool.
    </p>
    <p>The weight of an adult Pyrenean Mountain Shepherd Dog reaches 60 kg, height - 80 cm.</p>
    <h2 class="city"; id="razdel3">3. Tibetan mastiff</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/pict/tibetskij-mastif_1.jpg" alt="TMastiff" width="700" height="340"></p>
    <p>The history of this breed goes back to ancient times, when Tibetan monks used mastiffs as guard dogs, and nomads in the Himalayan mountains resorted to their strength and power for various working purposes.
        This hardy, calm and good-natured dog has been accompanying a person for many hundreds of years, being for him both a hardworking assistant and a courageous guard. However, the Tibetan Mastiff has an independent disposition and can feel completely independent and free, he is very self-sufficient and intelligent.
    <p>The weight of these dogs is in the range of 60-80 kg, height - 60-77 cm. The largest representative of the Tibetan Mastiff breed is a male named Lio Chang, his body weight exceeded 120 kg.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="city"; id="razdel4">4. Saint Bernard</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/pict/sbr.jpg" alt="Saint Bernard" width="700" height="370"></p>
    <p>The breed that became known to everyone after one amazing movie. These huge furry creatures are considered the finest rescue dogs.</p> 
    <p>However, unlike the Newfoundlands, they were bred specifically for rescue operations carried out on the ski slopes, and not in the water. The growth of an adult St. 
        Bernard reaches 80 cm and weighs 80 kg. But sometimes these friends of a person can grow up to 120 kg, and the dog Benedictine, who weighed as much as 166.4 kg at the time of fixing the record, became the record holder.</p>
    <h2 class="city"; id="razdel5">5. Alabai or Central Asian Shepherd Dog</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/pict/alabai.jpg" alt="Alabai" width="700" height="370"></p>
    <p>Strong and unpretentious dog. Individuals of this breed were originally used to help cattle farms in Central Asia. And this is not surprising, because they are surprisingly strong, hardy and able to adapt to any difficult situation. 
        <p>The height of an adult pass can reach 65 cm, and the weight ranges from 40 to 80 kg.</p> 
        <p>Despite all their power and rather impressive size, the Central Asian Shepherd Dogs are quite calm and friendly. They treat other pets and children well, but it is quite problematic for them to get along with other dogs.</p>
